this a kaggle competition which you can find here https://www.kaggle.com/c/football-match-probability-prediction 

## the dataset
this one of the most intresting dataset i worked with because I am a huge fan of football 
so this dataset give me the chance to apply my knowledge about football 
- I did a lot of feature engineering so I created analytics columns which I think to humans is crucial but I hope it was for model as well 
- this dataset is has to be dealt as sequence data so we made our model depend in that
